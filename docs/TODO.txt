TODO

DONE 1. Create Level Label in upper right hand corner
DONE 2. Advance level when all destructible bricks have been cleared
DONE 3. Increase ball speed every so often in level
DONE 4. Create 3 lives and change state between them correctly
DONE 5. Launch ball from paddle at beginning of game
DONE 6. Create an Endgame screen
DONE 7. Change paddle control to mouse movement
DONE 8. Ball redirection depending on position of paddle
9. Bonuses fall from the heavens, tri-ball, slow down, lazers
10. Improve the paddle control over where the ball is going to go. You can still get into infinite loops of ball direction with the limited control you have.
DONE 11. Create a simple way to restart the game when your game is over. Press 'y' for a new game. With appropriate screen.

KNOWN BUGS:

FIXED 1. If you have 500 points and you hit as long as you keep hitting indestructible blocks you will keep getting extra lifes :) Need to create an easy test level for this.
FIXED 2. If you right click with your last life it puts you into a quasi-gameover state.
3. It is possible to get into infinite bounce loops with the current model and levels
